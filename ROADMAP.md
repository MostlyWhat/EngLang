# EngLang Roadmap

## Introduction

EngLang is a programming language designed for simplicity, readability, and ease of use. It aims to make programming accessible to a wider audience by using plain English syntax and simple, straightforward concepts.

EngLang is designed to be a high-level language that abstracts away many of the complexities of lower-level languages, while still providing powerful functionality for developing real-world applications. It is a language, which compiles into Python, and is designed to be used in conjunction with or introducing Python.

The roadmap is designed to take EngLange from its initial proof-of-concept stage to a mature and fully-featured programming language. The roadmap is divided into six milestones, each of which builds on the previous one.

## Milestone 1: Proof of Concept (Version 0.1-0.2)

- Basic grammar and syntax design
- Lexer and parser implementation
- Interpreter for basic arithmetic expressions
- Basic data types: integers and strings
- Output functionality
- Error handling

## Milestone 2: Language Foundation (Version 0.3-0.4)

- Support for user-defined functions
- Conditional statements (if/else)
- Loop statements (for/while)
- Basic input functionality
- Basic error reporting

## Milestone 3: Built-in Libraries (Version 0.5-0.6)

- Standard Library with basic functionality for string and number manipulation
- Math Library with advanced mathematical functions
- File I/O Library for reading and writing files
- Error handling improvements

## Milestone 4: Advanced Language Features (Version 0.7-0.8)

- Object-oriented programming support
- Garbage collection
- Advanced data structures (e.g. arrays, dictionaries)
- Exception handling
- More sophisticated error reporting

## Milestone 5: Performance and Stability (Version 0.9-1.0)

- Stability improvements
- Performance optimizations
- Full test coverage
- Complete documentation
- Language specification

## Milestone 6: Expansion and Growth (Future Versions)

- Additional libraries for more advanced functionality
- Compatibility with other programming languages
- Integration with popular development environments
- Community-driven development
